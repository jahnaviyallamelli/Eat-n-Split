# Eat and Split React App
### Welcome to the Eat and Split React project! This app helps you manage shared food expenses among friends by splitting the costs evenly. You can maintain a list of friends, add food costs, and track who owes what for a meal.

## Usage
  - Adding Friends
    - Click on the Add Friend button to add a new friend to the list.
    - Enter the name of the friend in the input field and click Add.
  - Adding Food Costs
    - Enter the total cost of the food you ordered into the Food Cost input field.
    - The app will automatically split this cost evenly among all the friends.
  - Viewing Split Costs
    - Each friend's share of the total cost will be displayed under the Friends Owe section.
    - If a friend has paid more than their share, the difference will be displayed as Balance indicating how much they are owed or owe.

## Features

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
